# Battery Savings Issue Analysis - Time Offset & Data Structure

## Current Situation from Screenshot
- **Total shown**: €59.22
- **Chart pattern**: Positive values (green bars) in morning, negative values (red bars) in afternoon
- **User offset**: 6 hours set by default
- **Expected**: Around €10-20 for a typical day

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Backend vs Frontend Mismatch**
The issue appears to be that despite our backend fixes:
- Frontend might still be receiving incorrectly calculated data
- Time offset could be causing duplicate processing
- Backend calculation might not be using the dynamic time interval

### 2. **Potential Issues**

#### A. **Data Duplication from Time Offset**
- 6-hour offset could cause same data points to be processed multiple times
- Each timestamp could map to multiple time slots
- Result: Same savings counted 2-4 times

#### B. **Backend Still Using Fixed Intervals**
- Some code paths might still use the old calculation
- Service layer might not be using the dynamic time calculation
- Legacy code paths in PlantController show() method

#### C. **Negative Values Logic**
- Negative values should represent charging costs
- But they might be incorrectly calculated savings
- Current fix excludes them, but they might need to be fixed at source

### 3. **Verification Steps Needed**

#### A. **Check Browser Console**
1. Open Developer Tools → Console
2. Look for "BATTERY SAVINGS CALCULATION DEBUG" logs
3. Check if there are duplicate timestamps or offset issues

#### B. **Backend Logging**
1. Check if the new time interval calculation is being used
2. Verify that the backend is sending correct data
3. Look for "Using time interval for battery savings" logs

#### C. **Data Source Verification**
1. Check if all calculation paths use the new logic
2. Verify service layer is updated
3. Ensure no cached data with old calculations

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Clear browser cache** to ensure new frontend code is loaded
2. **Check console logs** for the debug information
3. **Verify backend logs** show correct time interval calculations
4. **Test with different time offsets** to isolate the offset issue
5. **Check data source** to ensure all paths use new calculation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- **Total savings**: €10-30 range (realistic daily amount)
- **No duplicate processing**: Each timestamp counted once
- **Time offset**: Visual only, doesn't affect calculation
- **Negative values**: Either excluded or fixed at source
