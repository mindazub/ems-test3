# User Data Recovery Summary

## Issue
All users disappeared from the database while the `users` table structure remained intact.

## Investigation
1. **Migration Status**: All migrations were properly applied, including the recent `add_time_offset_to_users_table` migration
2. **Table Structure**: The `users` table existed with correct columns including the new `time_offset` column
3. **User Count**: Database showed 0 users despite table existing
4. **Logs**: Recent logs showed that 5 users were active earlier today

## Root Cause
The users table data was cleared, but the table structure remained. This suggests either:
- A `php artisan migrate:fresh` command was run (resets all tables)
- A `php artisan db:wipe` command was run
- Manual database clearing occurred

## Resolution
1. **Restored Users**: Ran `php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder` to recreate the standard user accounts
2. **Verified Settings**: Ran `php artisan users:init-settings` to ensure proper time format preferences
3. **Tested Functionality**: Confirmed all tests pass and time format functionality works correctly

## Users Restored
- **Admin**: admin@admin.com (Role: admin)
- **Manager**: manager@demo.com (Role: manager) 
- **Installer**: installer@demo.com (Role: installer)
- **Mantas Zelba**: mantas@viasolis.eu (Role: customer)
- **Customer**: customer@demo.com (Role: customer)

## Current Status
✅ All users restored
✅ Time format preferences initialized (24-hour default)
✅ All tests passing
✅ PDF download functionality with debugging intact
✅ System fully operational

## Prevention
To avoid future data loss:
- Use `php artisan migrate` instead of `migrate:fresh` for production
- Always backup database before running migration commands
- Use seeders to quickly restore test data when needed

The system is now fully functional with all users restored and time format preferences properly configured.
